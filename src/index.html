          Hi, I'm Vini, a Technical Writer whose interests reside in the
          intersection between language and technology. My main areas of
          interest are <b>Blockchain, AI and Computer Graphics</b>. I'm also interested in
          Quality Assurance, UX Writing, and Localization.

          >As documentation is usually a very dynamic text genre, websites can
          change very frequently. For that reason, I tend to use links from the
          <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> to make sure those
          pages are still available for visualization.</i

        <h3>Shiba Inu</h3>
        <p>My most recent work is on <a href="https://docs.shib.io/">Shiba Inu Documentation Webpage</a>. Shiba Inu is a company that started from a Memecoin and later became a provider of
        different blockchain solutions, such as an L2, a Swap service and even Web3 games. For all those products, documentation is needed and that is why I was hired. We created those docs from scratch,
        comprising overall specifications, technical and non-technical tutorials.
        </p>

        <h3>Klever</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://klever.org/">Klever</a> is a very disruptive Web3 company whose employees are mostly
          very creative Brazilian individuals. Their flagship products are a
          crypto wallet, a crypto exchange and a blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the first and only technical writer in the company, I was
          responsible for the entire documentation, internal and external (<a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221005155925/https://docs.klever.finance/"
            >Klever documentation</a
          >), which involved API references and tutorials. I'd also take care of
          the company's knowledge management and the accuracy of the
          applications' microcopy - Ux writing.
        </p>

        <h3>Polygon Labs</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon Labs</a> is a behemoth
          in the crypto space. It basically offers solutions to the Ethereum
          lingering scalability issues through a number of Layer 2 alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Polygon Labs, I was part of an ever-changing Documentation team,
          that was directly responsible for the
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231112094021/https://wiki.polygon.technology/"
            >Wiki, the company's very comprehensive and extensive external
            documentation</a
          >. There, I would write, edit and manage technical articles for
          developers and researchers, as well as, test and produce instructional
          guides for end-users.

        <h4>Polygon ID</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id">Polygon ID</a>, now known as Privado ID, is a division of the Polygon company specialized in the
          Self-Soverign Identity business. It is an interesting way of managing
          credentials leveraging zero knowledge and powered by blockchain
          technology. I was the directly responsible individual for the ID's
          documentation, which meant that I had to vet all updates for the docs
          before they went live. I also managed the creation, management and
          deployment of this

      <!-- About Section -->
      <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm based in Rio de Janeiro. I hold a degree in Languages- Portuguese
          and English and am also pursuing a degree in Computer Systems. As a
          natural sequence from my graduation in Linguistics in 2008, I started
          my professional career as a high school and language institute teacher
          and tutor. I was driven to that area for an interest in how languages
          work and how pedagogical theories could be used to foster students
          learning. I worked for important language courses and a few
          traditional schools in Rio de Janeiro.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I can't stress enough how important teachers are for the
          world and how fulfilling that career could be for a lot of illuminated
          people, I wasn't too happy in the classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to pursue an old and persistent interest in technology,
          which would date back to my teenage years when I learned to assemble
          and configure computer pieces, a very valuable skill before the 2000s.
          I did a few courses, went back to university, and even became an
          intern again at the age of 30 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          I mixed all those incredible experiences together, balanced the best
          of each field and my own personal interests to decide that Technical
          Writing is my ideal career. Tech writers' skills combine all those
          interests I've always had in a practical and resourceful manner. It
          involves a deep knowledge of technology, which entangles coding,
          infrastructure, data analysis and other exciting fields; but at the
          same time it is deeply rooted in language and education, as it
          advocates the use of a clear and concise discourse to convey precise
          instructions and product knowledge.
