          Hi, I'm Vini, a Technical Writer whose interests reside in the
          intersection between language and technology. My main areas of
          interest are Localization (Translation, Management, and Engineering),
          Quality Assurance (mainly language-focused), AI and Natural Language
          Processing, UX Writing, and others.

          >As documentation is usually a very dynamic text genre, websites can
          change very frequently. For that reason, I tend to use links from the
          <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> to make sure those
          pages are still available for visualization.</i
